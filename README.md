# Facial Recognition Software Project

A comprehensive facial recognition system demonstrating advanced technical implementation and ethical considerations in AI-based recognition technologies. This project features a custom-built facial recognition pipeline with detection, matching, anonymization, and bias testing capabilities.

## Project Introduction

This advanced facial recognition system combines computer vision techniques with ethical considerations to create a robust, versatile application for face detection, identity matching, privacy protection, and algorithmic bias analysis. The system allows users to:

- Detect and locate faces in images and video feeds
- Match detected faces against known reference images
- Apply privacy-preserving filters to detected faces
- Analyze demographic bias in recognition performance
- Manage datasets for testing and analysis

Beyond technical functionality, the project serves as a practical exploration of important ethical questions surrounding facial recognition technologies, including privacy, consent, and algorithmic fairness.

2. Contextual error information preservation
3. Graceful degradation for hardware failures
4. User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Logging Implementation

Every operation is tracked with:

1. Entry and exit logging for key methods
2. Performance metrics logging for critical operations
3. ERROR level logging for exceptional conditions
4. Multi-destination logging (console, files)
