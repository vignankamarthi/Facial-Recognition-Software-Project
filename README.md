# Facial Recognition Software Project

A facial recognition system developed for a tech-philosophy class that demonstrates both technical capabilities and ethical considerations in AI-based recognition technologies.

## Project Overview

This project implements a facial recognition system with the following features:

- Real-time face detection using webcam feed
- Face matching against stored reference images
- Anonymization mode to protect privacy (face blurring/masking)
- Bias testing to demonstrate accuracy variations across different demographics

## Ethical Considerations

This project serves as both a functional demonstration and an ethical case study. Key ethical aspects explored:

- Privacy concerns in facial recognition
- Issues of consent when capturing biometric data
- Algorithmic bias in recognition systems
- Balancing security benefits with individual rights

For more detailed discussion, see [Ethical Discussion](docs/ethical_discussion.md).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Facial-Recognition-Software-Project.git
